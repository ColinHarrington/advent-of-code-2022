# Advent of Code 2022

I am attempting to do Advent of Code 2022 in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) this year.
See [rs/README.md](https://github.com/ColinHarrington/advent-of-code-2022/tree/main/rs) for details on how to run the project

I tend to optimize for readability vs over-rotating on raw performance

Merry Christmas!!
